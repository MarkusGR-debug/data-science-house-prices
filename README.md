💡 Key Highlights

    ✅ Built and normalized a relational database (1NF → 3NF).

    📈 Used SQL within R to query pricing trends by ward, month, and property type.

    🗃️ Applied extensive data cleaning and filtering to real-world datasets.

    🧠 Gained insights such as:

        Average house prices per quarter for selected years.

        Broadband coverage by region and tax band comparisons.

        Identified high-growth areas using temporal price trends.

🔍 Example Queries

Some of the R scripts demonstrate:

    Average house price in a given ward per month.

    Comparison between detached and semi-detached houses over time.

    Broadband availability in areas with lower council tax bands.

    Seasonal trends in the Oxfordshire property market.

Watch how the database is queried using R and how data insights are generated step-by-step.
